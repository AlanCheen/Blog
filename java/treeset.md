# TreeSet

```java
/**
 * A {@link NavigableSet} implementation based on a {@link TreeMap}.
 * The elements are ordered using their {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator} provided at set creation
 * time, depending on which constructor is used.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic
 * operations ({@code add}, {@code remove} and {@code contains}).
 *
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit
 * comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if it is to
 * correctly implement the {@code Set} interface.  (See {@code Comparable}
 * or {@code Comparator} for a precise definition of <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>.)  This is so because the {@code Set} interface is defined in
 * terms of the {@code equals} operation, but a {@code TreeSet} instance
 * performs all element comparisons using its {@code compareTo} (or
 * {@code compare}) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method
 * are, from the standpoint of the set, equal.  The behavior of a set
 * <i>is</i> well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it
 * just fails to obey the general contract of the {@code Set} interface.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a tree set concurrently, and at least one
 * of the threads modifies the set, it <i>must</i> be synchronized
 * externally.  This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some
 * object that naturally encapsulates the set.
 * If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedSet Collections.synchronizedSortedSet}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the set: <pre>
 *   SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by this class's {@code iterator} method are
 * <i>fail-fast</i>: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
 * created, in any way except through the iterator's own {@code remove}
 * method, the iterator will throw a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
 * and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
 * an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

基于 TreeMap



### 特性

- 想要存入 TreeSet 的元素必须是`Comparable`（实现这个接口），不然会报错； 
- 内部有个 Comparator ，会自动给元素排序；
-
